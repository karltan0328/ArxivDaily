Traditional experimental and computational methods face\nchallenges in terms of environmental constraints and computational demands,\nwhile current deep learning approaches still fall short in terms of precision\nand generality. In this work, we introduce the Geometric Diffusion Bridge\n(GDB), a novel generative modeling framework that accurately bridges initial\nand target geometric states. GDB leverages a probabilistic approach to evolve\ngeometric state distributions, employing an equivariant diffusion bridge\nderived by a modified version of Doob's $h$-transform for connecting geometric\nstates. This tailored diffusion process is anchored by initial and target\ngeometric states as fixed endpoints and governed by equivariant transition\nkernels. Moreover, trajectory data can be seamlessly leveraged in our GDB\nframework by using a chain of equivariant diffusion bridges, providing a more\ndetailed and accurate characterization of evolution dynamics. Theoretically, we\nconduct a thorough examination to confirm our framework's ability to preserve\njoint distributions of geometric states and capability to completely model the\nunderlying dynamics inducing trajectory distributions with negligible error.\nExperimental evaluations across various real-world scenarios show that GDB\nsurpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches, opening up a new pathway for\naccurately bridging geometric states and tackling crucial scientific challenges\nwith improved accuracy and applicability.\n","authors":["Shengjie Luo","Yixian Xu","Di He","Shuxin Zheng","Tie-Yan Liu","Liwei Wang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.24220v1.pdf","comment":"33 pages, 5 tables; NeurIPS 2024 Camera Ready version"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24218v1","updated":"2024-10-31T17:59:52Z","published":"2024-10-31T17:59:52Z","title":"Teaching Embodied Reinforcement Learning Agents: Informativeness and\n  Diversity of Language Use","summary":"  In real-world scenarios, it is desirable for embodied agents to have the\nability to leverage human language to gain explicit or implicit knowledge for\nlearning tasks. Despite recent progress, most previous approaches adopt simple\nlow-level instructions as language inputs, which may not reflect natural human\ncommunication. It's not clear how to incorporate rich language use to\nfacilitate task learning. To address this question, this paper studies\ndifferent types of language inputs in facilitating reinforcement learning (RL)\nembodied agents. More specifically, we examine how different levels of language\ninformativeness (i.e., feedback on past behaviors and future guidance) and\ndiversity (i.e., variation of language expressions) impact agent learning and\ninference. Our empirical results based on four RL benchmarks demonstrate that\nagents trained with diverse and informative language feedback can achieve\nenhanced generalization and fast adaptation to new tasks. These findings\nhighlight the pivotal role of language use in teaching embodied agents new\ntasks in an open world.

On one hand,\nopen-loop evaluation with real data is easy, but these results do not reflect\nclosed-loop performance. On the other, closed-loop evaluation is possible in\nsimulation, but is hard to scale due to its significant computational demands.\nFurther, the simulators available today exhibit a large domain gap to real\ndata. This has resulted in an inability to draw clear conclusions from the\nrapidly growing body of research on end-to-end autonomous driving. In this\npaper, we present NAVSIM, a middle ground between these evaluation paradigms,\nwhere we use large datasets in combination with a non-reactive simulator to\nenable large-scale real-world benchmarking. Specifically, we gather\nsimulation-based metrics, such as progress and time to collision, by unrolling\nbird's eye view abstractions of the test scenes for a short simulation horizon.\nOur simulation is non-reactive, i.e., the evaluated policy and environment do\nnot influence each other.

A key difficulty is that\nmuch of an optimizer's behavior is implicitly determined by complex oscillatory\ndynamics, referred to as the \"edge of stability.\" The main contribution of this\npaper is to show that an optimizer's implicit behavior can be explicitly\ncaptured by a \"central flow:\" a differential equation which models the\ntime-averaged optimization trajectory. We show that these flows can empirically\npredict long-term optimization trajectories of generic neural networks with a\nhigh degree of numerical accuracy. By interpreting these flows, we reveal for\nthe first time 1) the precise sense in which RMSProp adapts to the local loss\nlandscape, and 2) an \"acceleration via regularization\" mechanism, wherein\nadaptive optimizers implicitly navigate towards low-curvature regions in which\nthey can take larger steps.

In this paper, we find that the performance\ndegradation is due to a phenomenon called Length Collapse, where longer text\nembeddings collapse into a narrow space. This collapse results in a\ndistributional inconsistency between embeddings of different text lengths,\nultimately hurting the performance of downstream tasks. Theoretically, by\nconsidering the self-attention mechanism inherently functions as a low-pass\nfilter, we prove that long sequences increase the attenuation rate of the\nlow-pass filter effect of the self-attention mechanism. With layers going\ndeeper, excessive low-pass filtering causes the token signals to retain only\ntheir Direct-Current (DC) component, which means the input token feature maps\nwill collapse into a narrow space, especially in long texts. Based on the above\nanalysis, we propose to mitigate the undesirable length collapse limitation by\nintroducing a temperature in softmax(), which achieves a higher low-filter\nattenuation rate. The tuning-free method, called TempScale, can be plugged into\nmultiple transformer-based embedding models. Empirically, we demonstrate that\nTempScale can improve existing embedding models, especially on long text\ninputs, bringing up to 0.53% performance gains on 40 datasets from Massive Text\nEmbedding Benchmark (MTEB) and 0.82% performance gains on 4 datasets from\nLongEmbed, which specifically focuses on long context retrieval.\n","authors":["Yuqi Zhou","Sunhao Dai","Zhanshuo Cao","Xiao Zhang","Jun Xu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.24200v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24187v1","updated":"2024-10-31T17:49:44Z","published":"2024-10-31T17:49:44Z","title":"Chasing Better Deep Image Priors between Over- and\n  Under-parameterization","summary":"  Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are well-known to act as over-parameterized deep\nimage priors (DIP) that regularize various image inverse problems.

These two extremes push us to think whether there\nexists a better solution in the middle: between over- and under-parameterized\nimage priors, can one identify \"intermediate\" parameterized image priors that\nachieve better trade-offs between performance, efficiency, and even preserving\nstrong transferability? Drawing inspirations from the lottery ticket hypothesis\n(LTH), we conjecture and study a novel \"lottery image prior\" (LIP) by\nexploiting DNN inherent sparsity, stated as: given an over-parameterized\nDNN-based image prior, it will contain a sparse subnetwork that can be trained\nin isolation, to match the original DNN's performance when being applied as a\nprior to various image inverse problems.

However, most\nexisting works for TSC assume that traffic data from all surrounding\nintersections is fully and continuously available through sensors. In\nreal-world applications, this assumption often fails due to sensor malfunctions\nor data loss, making TSC with missing data a critical challenge. To meet the\nneeds of practical applications, we introduce DiffLight, a novel conditional\ndiffusion model for TSC under data-missing scenarios in the offline setting.\nSpecifically, we integrate two essential sub-tasks, i.e., traffic data\nimputation and decision-making, by leveraging a Partial Rewards Conditioned\nDiffusion (PRCD) model to prevent missing rewards from interfering with the\nlearning process. Meanwhile, to effectively capture the spatial-temporal\ndependencies among intersections, we design a Spatial-Temporal transFormer\n(STFormer) architecture. In addition, we propose a Diffusion Communication\nMechanism (DCM) to promote better communication and control performance under\ndata-missing scenarios.

Therefore, it is natural to\nemploy LLMs to assist with proposing useful high-level factors and crafting\ntheir measurements. Meanwhile, COAT also adopts CDs to find causal relations\namong the identified variables as well as to provide feedback to LLMs to\niteratively refine the proposed factors. We show that LLMs and CDs are mutually\nbeneficial and the constructed feedback provably also helps with the factor\nproposal. We construct and curate several synthetic and real-world benchmarks\nincluding analysis of human reviews and diagnosis of neuropathic and brain\ntumors, to comprehensively evaluate COAT. Extensive empirical results confirm\nthe effectiveness and reliability of COAT with significant improvements.\n","authors":["Chenxi Liu","Yongqiang Chen","Tongliang Liu","Mingming Gong","James Cheng","Bo Han","Kun Zhang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03941v2.pdf","comment":"NeurIPS 2024; Chenxi and Yongqiang contributed equally; 59 pages, 72\n  figures; Project page: https://causalcoat.github.io/"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12404v3","updated":"2024-10-31T12:27:14Z","published":"2024-04-15T17:49:16Z","title":"EPIC: Effective Prompting for Imbalanced-Class Data Synthesis in Tabular\n  Data Classification via Large Language Models","summary":"  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable in-context learning\ncapabilities across diverse applications.

In order to investigate the\nreasons for the performance decline of the edited model and optimize the\nediting method, this work explores the underlying reasons from both data and\nmodel perspectives.

These models typically leverage reconstructive autoencoders like VQGAN\nor VAE to encode pixels into a more compact latent space and learn the data\ndistribution in the latent space instead of directly from pixels. However, this\npractice raises a pertinent question: Is it truly the optimal choice? In\nresponse, we begin with an intriguing observation: despite sharing the same\nlatent space, autoregressive models significantly lag behind LDMs and MIMs in\nimage generation. This finding contrasts sharply with the field of NLP, where\nthe autoregressive model GPT has established a commanding presence. To address\nthis discrepancy, we introduce a unified perspective on the relationship\nbetween latent space and generative models, emphasizing the stability of latent\nspace in image generative modeling. Furthermore, we propose a simple but\neffective discrete image tokenizer to stabilize the latent space for image\ngenerative modeling by applying K-Means on the latent features of\nself-supervised learning models.

Since we employ an energy-based model (EBM) to\nrepresent the log density, our approach boils down to the joint training of a\ndiffusion model and an EBM.

However, in scenarios where some modalities are missing, many existing\nframeworks struggle to accommodate arbitrary modality combinations, often\nrelying heavily on a single modality or complete data. This oversight of\npotential modality combinations limits their applicability in real-world\nsituations. To address this challenge, we propose Flex-MoE (Flexible\nMixture-of-Experts), a new framework designed to flexibly incorporate arbitrary\nmodality combinations while maintaining robustness to missing data. The core\nidea of Flex-MoE is to first address missing modalities using a new missing\nmodality bank that integrates observed modality combinations with the\ncorresponding missing ones. This is followed by a uniquely designed Sparse MoE\nframework. Specifically, Flex-MoE first trains experts using samples with all\nmodalities to inject generalized knowledge through the generalized router\n($\\mathcal{G}$-Router). The $\\mathcal{S}$-Router then specializes in handling\nfewer modality combinations by assigning the top-1 gate to the expert\ncorresponding to the observed modality combination. We evaluate Flex-MoE on the\nADNI dataset, which encompasses four modalities in the Alzheimer's Disease\ndomain, as well as on the MIMIC-IV dataset. The results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of Flex-MoE highlighting its ability to model arbitrary modality\ncombinations in diverse missing modality scenarios.

Theoretically explaining the benefits of complex\nparameterizations for SSMs is an open problem. The current paper takes a step\ntowards its resolution, by establishing formal gaps between real and complex\ndiagonal SSMs. Firstly, we prove that while a moderate dimension suffices in\norder for a complex SSM to express all mappings of a real SSM, a much higher\ndimension is needed for a real SSM to express mappings of a complex SSM.\nSecondly, we prove that even if the dimension of a real SSM is high enough to\nexpress a given mapping, typically, doing so requires the parameters of the\nreal SSM to hold exponentially large values, which cannot be learned in\npractice. In contrast, a complex SSM can express any given mapping with\nmoderate parameter values.

In this work, we\npropose a novel method to differentiate monaural snoring from non-snoring\nsounds by analyzing the harmonic content of the input sound using\nharmonic/percussive sound source separation (HPSS). The resulting feature,\nbased on the harmonic spectrogram from HPSS, is employed as input data for\nconventional neural network architectures, aiming to enhance snoring detection\nperformance even under a limited data learning framework. To evaluate the\nperformance of our proposal, we studied two different scenarios: 1) using a\nlarge dataset of snoring and interfering sounds, and 2) using a reduced\ntraining set composed of around 1% of the data material. In the former\nscenario, the proposed HPSS-based feature provides competitive results compared\nto other input features from the literature.

We illustrate the inconsistencies between\nreward models empirically on numerous open-source datasets.\n  We theoretically show that the fluctuation of the reward models can be\ndetrimental to the alignment problem because the derived policies are more\noverfitted to the reward model and, hence, are riskier if the reward model\nitself is uncertain. We use concentration of measure to motivate an\nuncertainty-aware, conservative algorithm for policy optimization. We show that\nsuch policies are more risk-averse in the sense that they are more cautious of\nuncertain rewards.

Yet controlling what a large language model should not\nknow is important for ensuring alignment and thus safe use. However, accurately\nand efficiently unlearning knowledge from an LLM remains challenging due to the\npotential collateral damage caused by the fuzzy boundary between retention and\nforgetting, and the large computational requirements for optimization across\nstate-of-the-art models with hundreds of billions of parameters. In this work,\nwe present \\textbf{Embedding-COrrupted (ECO) Prompts}, a lightweight unlearning\nframework for large language models to address both the challenges of knowledge\nentanglement and unlearning efficiency. Instead of relying on the LLM itself to\nunlearn, we enforce an unlearned state during inference by employing a prompt\nclassifier to identify and safeguard prompts to forget. We learn corruptions\nadded to prompt embeddings via zeroth order optimization toward the unlearning\nobjective offline and corrupt prompts flagged by the classifier during\ninference. We find that these embedding-corrupted prompts not only lead to\ndesirable outputs that satisfy the unlearning objective but also closely\napproximate the output from a model that has never been trained on the data\nintended for forgetting.

However, these black-box systems\nface challenges regarding explainability during training and inference\nprocesses. An important question is how to incorporate explicit knowledge into\nthese implicit models, thereby designing expert-driven and interpretable\nviolence surveillance systems. This paper proposes a new paradigm for weakly\nsupervised violence monitoring (WSVM) called Rule base Violence monitoring\n(RuleVM). The proposed RuleVM uses a dual-branch structure for different\ndesigns for images and text. One of the branches is called the implicit branch,\nwhich uses only visual features for coarse-grained binary classification. In\nthis branch, image feature extraction is divided into two channels: one\nresponsible for extracting scene frames and the other focusing on extracting\nactions. The other branch is called the explicit branch, which utilizes\nlanguage-image alignment to perform fine-grained classification. For the\nlanguage channel design in the explicit branch, the proposed RuleCLIP uses the\nstate-of-the-art YOLO-World model to detect objects and actions in video\nframes, and association rules are identified through data mining methods as\ndescriptions of the video. Leveraging the dual-branch architecture, RuleVM\nachieves interpretable coarse-grained and fine-grained violence surveillance.\nExtensive experiments were conducted on two commonly used benchmarks, and the\nresults show that RuleCLIP achieved the best performance in both coarse-grained\nand fine-grained detection, significantly outperforming existing\nstate-of-the-art methods.

Kernel looping eliminates\nsynchronization costs between consecutive calls to the same kernel by\ntransforming these calls into a single call to a modified kernel containing a\npipelined outer loop.

Based on this, we propose a novel approach,\nDiffusion-DICE, that directly performs this transformation using diffusion\nmodels. We find that the optimal policy's score function can be decomposed into\ntwo terms: the behavior policy's score function and the gradient of a guidance\nterm which depends on the optimal distribution ratio. The first term can be\nobtained from a diffusion model trained on the dataset and we propose an\nin-sample learning objective to learn the second term.

When restricting to concrete\nclasses of graphs and assuming SETH, planar graphs and minor-free graphs admit\ntruly subquadratic algorithms, while geometric intersection graphs of unit\nballs, congruent equilateral triangles, and unit segments do not. Unit-disk\ngraphs are one of the major open cases where the complexity of diameter\ncomputation remains unknown.

When elicitation\nis feasible, this amounts to a fairly standard principal-agent-style mechanism\ndesign problem, where the persuader employs a mechanism to first elicit the\nagent's type and then plays the corresponding persuasion strategy based on the\nagent's report. The optimal mechanism design problem in this setting is\nrelatively well-understood in the literature, with incentive compatible (IC)\nmechanisms known to be optimal and computationally tractable. In this paper, we\nstudy this problem given a credible agent, i.e., if the agent claims they are\nof a certain type in response to the mechanism's elicitation, then they will\nact optimally with respect to the claimed type, even if they are actually not\nof that type.\n  We present several interesting findings in this new setting that differ\nsignificantly from results in the non-credible setting. In terms of the\nstructure of optimal mechanisms, we show that not only may IC mechanisms fail\nto be optimal, but all mechanisms following the standard\n`eliciting-then-persuading' mechanism design structure may be suboptimal. To\nachieve optimality requires two additional instruments -- pre-signaling and\nnon-binding elicitation -- which naturally result in multi-stage mechanisms. We\ncharacterize optimal mechanisms under these design choices. Based on our\ncharacterization, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm for computing optimal\nmulti-stage mechanisms. We also discover that in scenarios that allow for it,\npartial information elicitation can be employed to improve the principal's\npayoff even further.

This--seemingly simple--task has led to\na rich literature and has become well known in the context of the US House of\nRepresentatives. In this paper, we connect the design of monotone apportionment\nmethods to classic problems from discrete geometry and combinatorial\noptimization and explore the extent to which randomization can enhance\nproportionality.\n  We first focus on the well-studied family of stationary divisor methods,\nwhich satisfy the strong population monotonicity property, and show that this\nfamily produces only a slightly superlinear number of different outputs as a\nfunction of the number of states. While our upper and lower bounds leave a\nsmall gap, we show that--surprisingly--closing this gap would solve a\nlong-standing open problem from discrete geometry, known as the complexity of\n$k$-levels in line arrangements. The main downside of divisor methods is their\nviolation of the quota axiom, i.e., every state should receive $\\lfloor\nq_i\\rfloor$ or $\\lceil q_i\\rceil$ seats, where $q_i$ is the proportional share\nof the state. As we show that randomizing over divisor methods can only\npartially overcome this issue, we propose a relaxed version of divisor methods\nin which the total number of seats may slightly deviate from the house size. By\nrandomizing over them, we can simultaneously satisfy population monotonicity,\nquota, and ex-ante proportionality.\n  Finally, we turn our attention to quota-compliant methods that are\nhouse-monotone, i.e., no state may lose a seat when the house size is\nincreased. We provide a polyhedral characterization based on network flows,\nwhich implies a simple description of all ex-ante proportional randomized\nmethods that are house-monotone and quota-compliant.\n","authors":["Javier Cembrano","José Correa","Ulrike Schmidt-Kraepelin","Alexandros Tsigonias-Dimitriadis","Victor Verdugo"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.23869v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13788v2","updated":"2024-10-31T11:37:46Z","published":"2024-05-22T16:12:45Z","title":"Quantum algorithm for large-scale market equilibrium computation","summary":"  Classical algorithms for market equilibrium computation such as proportional\nresponse dynamics face scalability issues with Internet-based applications such\nas auctions, recommender systems, and fair division, despite having an almost\nlinear runtime in terms of the product of buyers and goods.

Previous methods typically focus on a single view or map\nattention to the scene via estimated gaze, failing to exploit the implicit\nconnection between them. Moreover, simple fusion modules are insufficient for\nmodeling the complex relationships between the two views, making information\nintegration challenging. To address these issues, we propose a novel method for\nend-to-end scene-associated driver attention estimation, called EraW-Net. This\nmethod enhances the most discriminative dynamic cues, refines feature\nrepresentations, and facilitates semantically aligned cross-domain integration\nthrough a W-shaped architecture, termed W-Net.

Additionally, to track driver states during non-fixed facial\nposes, we propose a Global Context Sharing Module (GCS-Module) to construct\nrefined feature representations by capturing hierarchical features that adapt\nto various scales of head and eye movements.

Conversely, two-sensor systems\nwithout extrinsic calibration offer a cost-effective alternative but are unable\nto calculate depth using stereo techniques. In this work, we propose a method\nto overcome this challenge by leveraging facial attributes to derive disparity\ninformation and estimate relative depth for anti-spoofing purposes, using\nnon-calibrated systems. We introduce a multi-modal anti-spoofing model, coined\nDisparity Model, that incorporates created disparity maps as a third modality\nalongside the two original sensor modalities. We demonstrate the effectiveness\nof the Disparity Model in countering various spoof attacks using a\ncomprehensive dataset collected from the Intel RealSense ID Solution F455. Our\nmethod outperformed existing methods in the literature, achieving an Equal\nError Rate (EER) of 1.71% and a False Negative Rate (FNR) of 2.77% at a False\nPositive Rate (FPR) of 1%.

However, EPI is vulnerable to off-resonance effects, leading to\ntissue susceptibility and eddy-current induced distortions. The latter is\nparticularly problematic because it causes misalignment between volumes,\ndisrupting downstream modelling and analysis. The essential correction of eddy\ndistortions is typically done post-acquisition, with image registration.\nHowever, this is non-trivial because correspondence between volumes can be\nseverely disrupted due to volume-specific signal attenuations induced by\nvarying directions and strengths of the applied gradients. This challenge has\nbeen successfully addressed by the popular FSL~Eddy tool but at considerable\ncomputational cost.

The\nbiggest bottleneck is the scarcity of annotated 3D data, whereas 2D image\ndatasets are abundant and richly annotated. Consequently, it is intuitive to\nleverage the wealth of annotations in 2D images to alleviate the inherent data\nscarcity in OV-3Det. In this paper, we push the task setup to its limits by\nexploring the potential of using solely 2D images to learn OV-3Det.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework ImOV3D to\nleverage pseudo multimodal representation containing both images and point\nclouds (PC) to close the modality gap. The key of ImOV3D lies in flexible\nmodality conversion where 2D images can be lifted into 3D using monocular depth\nestimation and can also be derived from 3D scenes through rendering.

Recently, diffusion denoising bridge models (DDBMs), a new formulation of\ngenerative modeling that builds stochastic processes between fixed data\nendpoints based on a reference diffusion process, have achieved empirical\nsuccess across tasks with coupled data distribution, such as image-to-image\ntranslation. However, DDBM's sampling process typically requires hundreds of\nnetwork evaluations to achieve decent performance, which may impede their\npractical deployment due to high computational demands. In this work, inspired\nby the recent advance of consistency models in DMs, we tackle this problem by\nlearning the consistency function of the probability-flow ordinary differential\nequation (PF-ODE) of DDBMs, which directly predicts the solution at a starting\nstep given any point on the ODE trajectory. Based on a dedicated general-form\nODE solver, we propose two paradigms: consistency bridge distillation and\nconsistency bridge training, which is flexible to apply on DDBMs with broad\ndesign choices.

Through statistical observations, we have\nidentified two common challenges faced by different OOD detectors:\nmisidentifying tail class ID samples as OOD, while erroneously predicting OOD\nsamples as head class from ID. To explain this phenomenon, we introduce a\ngeneralized statistical framework, termed ImOOD, to formulate the OOD detection\nproblem on imbalanced data distribution. Consequently, the theoretical analysis\nreveals that there exists a class-aware bias item between balanced and\nimbalanced OOD detection, which contributes to the performance gap.

These studies achieve more accurate modeling of sRGB noise\ncompared to traditional noise modeling methods. However, there are performance\nlimitations due to the inherent characteristics of each generative model. To\naddress this issue, we propose NM-FlowGAN, a hybrid approach that exploits the\nstrengths of both GAN and Normalizing Flows. We combine pixel-wise noise\nmodeling networks based on Normalizing Flows and spatial correlation modeling\nnetworks based on GAN. Specifically, the pixel-wise noise modeling network\nleverages the high training stability of Normalizing Flows to capture noise\ncharacteristics that are affected by a multitude of factors, and the spatial\ncorrelation networks efficiently model pixel-to-pixel relationships.

Weakly supervised learning (WSL) based on\nsparse annotation has achieved encouraging performance and demonstrated the\npotential to reduce annotation costs. This study attempts to introduce\nscribble-based WSL into ultrasound image segmentation tasks. However,\nultrasound images often suffer from poor contrast and unclear edges, coupled\nwith insufficient supervison signals for edges, posing challenges to edge\nprediction. Uncertainty modeling has been proven to facilitate models in\ndealing with these issues. Nevertheless, existing uncertainty estimation\nparadigms are not robust enough and often filter out predictions near decision\nboundaries, resulting in unstable edge predictions. Therefore, we propose\nleveraging predictions near decision boundaries effectively. Specifically, we\nintroduce Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) of evidence to design an Evidence-Guided\nConsistency strategy. This strategy utilizes high-evidence predictions, which\nare more likely to occur near high-density regions, to guide the optimization\nof low-evidence predictions that may appear near decision boundaries.\nFurthermore, the diverse sizes and locations of lesions in ultrasound images\npose a challenge for CNNs with local receptive fields, as they struggle to\nmodel global information.

These models typically leverage reconstructive autoencoders like VQGAN\nor VAE to encode pixels into a more compact latent space and learn the data\ndistribution in the latent space instead of directly from pixels. However, this\npractice raises a pertinent question: Is it truly the optimal choice? In\nresponse, we begin with an intriguing observation: despite sharing the same\nlatent space, autoregressive models significantly lag behind LDMs and MIMs in\nimage generation. This finding contrasts sharply with the field of NLP, where\nthe autoregressive model GPT has established a commanding presence. To address\nthis discrepancy, we introduce a unified perspective on the relationship\nbetween latent space and generative models, emphasizing the stability of latent\nspace in image generative modeling. Furthermore, we propose a simple but\neffective discrete image tokenizer to stabilize the latent space for image\ngenerative modeling by applying K-Means on the latent features of\nself-supervised learning models. Experimental results show that image\nautoregressive modeling with our tokenizer (DiGIT) benefits both image\nunderstanding and image generation with the next token prediction principle,\nwhich is inherently straightforward for GPT models but challenging for other\ngenerative models.

In the recent era,\nskeleton-based HAR has received much attention because skeleton data has shown\nthat it can handle changes in striking, body size, camera views, and complex\nbackgrounds. One key characteristic of ST-GCN is automatically learning spatial\nand temporal patterns from skeleton sequences. It has some limitations, as this\nmethod only works for short-range correlation due to its limited receptive\nfield. Consequently, understanding human action requires long-range\ninterconnection. To address this issue, we developed a quantum spatial-temporal\nrelative transformer ST-RTR model. The ST-RTR includes joint and relay nodes,\nwhich allow efficient communication and data transmission within the network.\nThese nodes help to break the inherent spatial and temporal skeleton\ntopologies, which enables the model to understand long-range human action\nbetter. Furthermore, we combine quantum ST-RTR with a fusion model for further\nperformance improvements. To assess the performance of the quantum ST-RTR\nmethod, we conducted experiments on three skeleton-based HAR benchmarks: NTU\nRGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and UAV-Human.

However, these black-box systems\nface challenges regarding explainability during training and inference\nprocesses. An important question is how to incorporate explicit knowledge into\nthese implicit models, thereby designing expert-driven and interpretable\nviolence surveillance systems. This paper proposes a new paradigm for weakly\nsupervised violence monitoring (WSVM) called Rule base Violence monitoring\n(RuleVM). The proposed RuleVM uses a dual-branch structure for different\ndesigns for images and text. One of the branches is called the implicit branch,\nwhich uses only visual features for coarse-grained binary classification. In\nthis branch, image feature extraction is divided into two channels: one\nresponsible for extracting scene frames and the other focusing on extracting\nactions. The other branch is called the explicit branch, which utilizes\nlanguage-image alignment to perform fine-grained classification. For the\nlanguage channel design in the explicit branch, the proposed RuleCLIP uses the\nstate-of-the-art YOLO-World model to detect objects and actions in video\nframes, and association rules are identified through data mining methods as\ndescriptions of the video. Leveraging the dual-branch architecture, RuleVM\nachieves interpretable coarse-grained and fine-grained violence surveillance.\nExtensive experiments were conducted on two commonly used benchmarks, and the\nresults show that RuleCLIP achieved the best performance in both coarse-grained\nand fine-grained detection, significantly outperforming existing\nstate-of-the-art methods. Moreover, interpretability experiments uncovered some\ninteresting rules, such as the observation that as the number of people\nincreases, the risk level of violent behavior also rises.\n","authors":["Wen-Dong Jiang","Chih-Yung Chang","Hsiang-Chuan Chang","Diptendu Sinha Roy"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.21991v2.pdf","comment":"12 pages,7 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23687v1","updated":"2024-10-31T07:22:51Z","published":"2024-10-31T07:22:51Z","title":"Adversarial Attacks of Vision Tasks in the Past 10 Years: A Survey","summary":"  Adversarial attacks, which manipulate input data to undermine model\navailability and integrity, pose significant security threats during machine\nlearning inference.

Owing to their powerful\ngeneralizability, pre-trained vision-language models such as Contrastive\nLanguage-Image Pre-training (CLIP) have lately gained traction as practical CL\ncandidates. However, the domain mismatch between the pre-training and the\ndownstream CL tasks often calls for finetuning of the CLIP on the latter. Most\nexisting finetuning methods exhibit deterministic nature. This makes them\noverlook the many possible interactions across the input modalities and deems\nthem unsafe for high-risk tasks requiring reliable uncertainty estimation. To\naddress these, our work proposes Continual LeArning with Probabilistic\nfinetuning (CLAP) - a probabilistic modeling framework over visual-guided text\nfeatures per task, thus providing more calibrated CL finetuning. Unlike recent\ndata-hungry anti-forgetting CL techniques, CLAP alleviates forgetting by\nexploiting the rich pre-trained knowledge of CLIP for weight initialization and\ndistribution regularization of task-specific parameters.

Irrespective of\nsnoring types, most snoring instances exhibit identifiable harmonic patterns\nmanifested through distinctive energy distributions over time. In this work, we\npropose a novel method to differentiate monaural snoring from non-snoring\nsounds by analyzing the harmonic content of the input sound using\nharmonic/percussive sound source separation (HPSS). The resulting feature,\nbased on the harmonic spectrogram from HPSS, is employed as input data for\nconventional neural network architectures, aiming to enhance snoring detection\nperformance even under a limited data learning framework. To evaluate the\nperformance of our proposal, we studied two different scenarios: 1) using a\nlarge dataset of snoring and interfering sounds, and 2) using a reduced\ntraining set composed of around 1% of the data material. In the former\nscenario, the proposed HPSS-based feature provides competitive results compared\nto other input features from the literature. However, the key advantage of the\nproposed method lies in the superior performance of the harmonic spectrogram\nderived from HPSS in a limited data learning context. In this particular\nscenario, using the proposed harmonic feature significantly enhances the\nperformance of all the studied architectures in comparison to the classical\ninput features documented in the existing literature.

Moreover, the\ndiversity and dynamic nature of mobile systems exacerbate this challenge. In\nresponse, we present a shift to \\textit{opportunistic} inference for\nasynchronous distributed multi-modal data, enabling inference as soon as\npartial data arrives. While existing methods focus on optimizing modality\nconsistency and complementarity, known as modal affinity, they lack a\n\\textit{computational} approach to control this affinity in open-world mobile\nenvironments. AdaFlow pioneers the formulation of structured cross-modality\naffinity in mobile contexts using a hierarchical analysis-based normalized\nmatrix. This approach accommodates the diversity and dynamics of modalities,\ngeneralizing across different types and numbers of inputs.

Traditional cortical circuit models are notoriously\ndifficult to train due to expansive nonlinearities in the dynamical system,\nleading to an optimization problem with nonlinear stability constraints that\nare difficult to impose. Conversely, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) excel in\ntasks involving sequential data but lack biological plausibility and\ninterpretability. In this work, we address these challenges by linking dynamic\ndivisive normalization (DN) to the stability of ORGaNICs, a biologically\nplausible recurrent cortical circuit model that dynamically achieves DN and\nthat has been shown to simulate a wide range of neurophysiological phenomena.\nBy using the indirect method of Lyapunov, we prove the remarkable property of\nunconditional local stability for an arbitrary-dimensional ORGaNICs circuit\nwhen the recurrent weight matrix is the identity. We thus connect ORGaNICs to a\nsystem of coupled damped harmonic oscillators, which enables us to derive the\ncircuit's energy function, providing a normative principle of what the circuit,\nand individual neurons, aim to accomplish. Further, for a generic recurrent\nweight matrix, we prove the stability of the 2D model and demonstrate\nempirically that stability holds in higher dimensions. Finally, we show that\nORGaNICs can be trained by backpropagation through time without gradient\nclipping/scaling, thanks to its intrinsic stability property and adaptive time\nconstants, which address the problems of exploding, vanishing, and oscillating\ngradients. By evaluating the model's performance on RNN benchmarks, we find\nthat ORGaNICs outperform alternative neurodynamical models on static image\nclassification tasks and perform comparably to LSTMs on sequential tasks.\n","authors":["Shivang Rawat","David J.

First, we introduce a\nself-supervised approach to learn a behavior encoder that produces discretized\ntokens for behavior trajectories $\\tau = \\{o_0, a_0, \\dots\\}$ and an imitation\nlearning policy decoder conditioned on these tokens. These additional behavior\ntokens will be augmented to the vocabulary of pretrained Multimodal Language\nModels. With this encoder, we then pack long-term multimodal interactions\ninvolving task instructions, memories, thoughts, observations, textual\nresponses, behavior trajectories, etc into unified token sequences and model\nthem with autoregressive transformers. Thanks to the semantically meaningful\nbehavior tokens, the resulting VLA model, OmniJARVIS, can reason (by producing\nchain-of-thoughts), plan, answer questions, and act (by producing behavior\ntokens for the imitation learning policy decoder). OmniJARVIS demonstrates\nexcellent performances on a comprehensive collection of atomic, programmatic,\nand open-ended tasks in open-world Minecraft. Our analysis further unveils the\ncrucial design principles in interaction data formation, unified tokenization,\nand its scaling potentials.

Thus, an image with low\ncontrast has a smaller impact on learning than an image with higher contrast,\nand a very bright or very dark image has a stronger impact on the weights than\nan image with moderate brightness. In this work, we propose performing gradient\ndescent on the embeddings produced by the first layer of the model. However,\nswitching to discrete inputs with an embedding layer is not a reasonable option\nfor vision models. Thus, we propose the conceptual procedure of (i) a gradient\ndescent step on first layer activations to construct an activation proposal,\nand (ii) finding the optimal weights of the first layer, i.e., those weights\nwhich minimize the squared distance to the activation proposal. We provide a\nclosed form solution of the procedure and adjust it for robust stochastic\ntraining while computing everything efficiently.

Our approach\niteratively decomposes weight matrices while considering the significance of\neach parameter, resulting in an approximately 1-bit per parameter residual\nblock in each decomposition iteration. These blocks are sorted and stacked in\nstorage as basic transmission units, with different quantities loaded based on\ncurrent memory availability. Extensive experiments across a wide range of tasks\ndemonstrate that, despite offering fine-grained size control, BitStack\nconsistently matches or surpasses strong quantization baselines, particularly\nat extreme compression ratios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\ndecomposition-based method that effectively bridges the gap to practical\ncompression techniques like quantization.

Topological conjugacy, a notion from dynamical\nsystems theory, provides a precise definition of dynamical equivalence,\noffering a possible route to address this need.

However, existing works mainly focus on the\napplication of diffusion policies in offline RL, while their incorporation into\nonline RL is less investigated. The training objective of the diffusion model,\nknown as the variational lower bound, cannot be optimized directly in online RL\ndue to the unavailability of 'good' actions. This leads to difficulties in\nconducting diffusion policy improvement. To overcome this, we propose a novel\nmodel-free diffusion-based online RL algorithm, Q-weighted Variational Policy\nOptimization (QVPO).

While studies\ndevelop various AV representation learning frameworks, the importance of AV\ndata alignment is usually undermined for achieving high-quality representation.\nWe observe that an audio signal may contain background noise interference.\nAlso, non-synchronization may appear between audio and video streams. These\nnon-strict data alignment limits representation quality and downgrade\napplication performance. In this paper, we propose to improve AV joint\nrepresentations from a data-centric perspective by aligning audio signals to\nvisual data. Our alignment is conducted in an agentic workflow controlled by an\nLLM-based assistant named AVAgent. For each input AV data pair, our AVAgent\nuses a multi-modal LLM to convert audio and visual data into language\ndescriptions separately (i.e., tool use). Then, AVAgent reasons whether this\npaired data is aligned well and plans to edit the audio signal if needed (i.e.,\nplanning). The audio editing is executed by predefined actions that filter\nnoise or augment data. Moreover, we use a VLM to evaluate how modified audio\nsignals match the visual content and provide feedback to AVAgent (i.e.,\nreflection). The tool use, planning, and reflection steps operate cyclically to\nbecome an agentic workflow where audio signals are gradually aligned to visual\ncontent.

This elastic tether is unusual as it creates a\ndisturbance proportional to the multicopter's translational movement. This\npaper takes an observer-based approach to estimate the stiffness coefficient of\nthe cable and uses the system model to update the estimates of the external\nforces, which are then compensated in the control action. Given that the\ntethered cable force affects both horizontal channels of the quadrotor and is\nalso coupled with the vertical channel, the proposed disturbance observer is\nconstructed to exploit the redundant measurements across all three channels to\njointly estimate the cable stiffness and the vertical disturbance. A\npseudo-inverse method is used to determine the observer gain functions, such\nthat the estimation of the two quantities is decoupled and stable. Compared to\nstandard disturbance observers which assume nearly constant disturbances, the\nproposed approach can quickly adjust its total force estimate as the tethered\nquadrotor changes its position or tautness of the tether.

In this paper, we make a number of\ncontributions, ultimately establishing that the weight-one dilated entropy\n(DilEnt) distance-generating function is optimal up to logarithmic factors. The\nDilEnt regularizer is notable due to its iterate-equivalence with Kernelized\nOMWU (KOMWU) -- the algorithm with state-of-the-art dependence on the game tree\nsize in extensive-form games -- when used in conjunction with the online mirror\ndescent (OMD) algorithm.

In this paper, we\ninvestigate the feasibility of creating smaller, highly-performing specialized\nalgorithms by way of fine-tuning. To do this, we first present a large\npre-trained model with 20 unique scenarios that combine different social\ncontexts with games of varying social dilemmas, record its answers, and use\nthem for Q&A fine-tuning on a smaller model of the same family. Our focus is on\nin-context game-theoretic decision-making, the same domain within which human\ninteraction occurs and that requires both a theory of mind (or a semblance\nthereof) and an understanding of social dynamics. The smaller model is\ntherefore trained not just on the answers provided, but also on the motivations\nprovided by the larger model, which should contain advice and guidelines to\nnavigate both strategic dilemmas and social cues.

Building upon\nprior literature, we propose two forms of digital divide in the generative AI\nadoption process: (i) the learning divide, capturing individuals' heterogeneous\nabilities to update their perceived utility of ChatGPT; and (ii) the utility\ndivide, representing differences in individuals' actual utility derived from\nper use of ChatGPT. To evaluate these two divides, we develop a Bayesian\nlearning model that incorporates demographic heterogeneities in both the\nutility and signal functions. Leveraging a six-month clickstream dataset, we\nestimate the model and find significant learning and utility divides across\nvarious demographic attributes. Interestingly, lower-educated and non-white\nindividuals derive higher utility gains from ChatGPT but learn about its\nutility at a slower rate. Furthermore, males, younger individuals, and those\nwith an IT background not only derive higher utility per use from ChatGPT but\nalso learn about its utility more rapidly. Besides, we document a phenomenon\ntermed the belief trap, wherein users underestimate ChatGPT's utility, opt not\nto use the tool, and consequently lack new experiences to update their\nperceptions, leading to continued underutilization. Our simulation further\ndemonstrates that the learning divide can significantly affect the probability\nof falling into the belief trap, another form of the digital divide in adoption\noutcomes (i.e., outcome divide); however, offering training programs can\nalleviate the belief trap and mitigate the divide.\n","authors":["Lijia Ma","Xingchen Xu","Yumei He","Yong Tan"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.19806v2.pdf","comment":"43 pages, 3 figures, 6 tables"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23218v1","updated":"2024-10-30T17:10:19Z","published":"2024-10-30T17:10:19Z","title":"OS-ATLAS: A Foundation Action Model for Generalist GUI Agents","summary":"  Existing efforts in building GUI agents heavily rely on the availability of\nrobust commercial Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as GPT-4o and\nGeminiProVision.

In order to attain the objective, we\nperform transfer learning by employing deep learning models pre-trained on the\nImageNet and Urbansound8k datasets for the improvement on the precision of\nvocal technique evaluation. Furthermore, we tackle the problem of the lack of\nsamples by constructing a dedicated dataset, the Mezzo-soprano Vocal Set (MVS),\nfor vocal technique assessment. Our experimental results indicate that transfer\nlearning increases the overall accuracy (OAcc) of all models by an average of\n8.3%, with the highest accuracy at 94.2%. We not only provide a novel approach\nto evaluating Mezzo-soprano vocal techniques but also introduce a new\nquantitative assessment method for music education.\n","authors":["Zhenyi Hou","Xu Zhao","Kejie Ye","Xinyu Sheng","Shanggerile Jiang","Jiajing Xia","Yitao Zhang","Chenxi Ban","Daijun Luo","Jiaxing Chen","Yan Zou","Yuchao Feng","Guangyu Fan","Xin Yuan"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.23325v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22803v1","updated":"2024-10-30T08:31:58Z","published":"2024-10-30T08:31:58Z","title":"DOA-Aware Audio-Visual Self-Supervised Learning for Sound Event\n  Localization and Detection","summary":"  This paper describes sound event localization and detection (SELD) for\nspatial audio recordings captured by firstorder ambisonics (FOA) microphones.\nIn this task, one may train a deep neural network (DNN) using FOA data\nannotated with the classes and directions of arrival (DOAs) of sound events.\nHowever, the performance of this approach is severely bounded by the amount of\nannotated data.

Due to the lack of large-scale in-domain robotic datasets,\nprior works utilize in-the-wild human videos to pre-train robotic visual\nrepresentation. Despite their promising results, representations from human\nvideos are inevitably subject to distribution shifts and lack the dynamics\ninformation crucial for task completion. We first evaluate various pre-trained\nrepresentations in terms of their correlation to the downstream robotic\nmanipulation tasks (i.e., manipulation centricity). Interestingly, we find that\nthe \"manipulation centricity\" is a strong indicator of success rates when\napplied to downstream tasks. Drawing from these findings, we propose\nManipulation Centric Representation (MCR), a foundation representation learning\nframework capturing both visual features and the dynamics information such as\nactions and proprioceptions of manipulation tasks to improve manipulation\ncentricity. Specifically, we pre-train a visual encoder on the DROID robotic\ndataset and leverage motion-relevant data such as robot proprioceptive states\nand actions. We introduce a novel contrastive loss that aligns visual\nobservations with the robot's proprioceptive state-action dynamics, combined\nwith a behavior cloning (BC)-like actor loss to predict actions during\npre-training, along with a time contrastive loss. Empirical results across 4\nsimulation domains with 20 tasks verify that MCR outperforms the strongest\nbaseline method by 14.8%. Moreover, MCR boosts the performance of\ndata-efficient learning with a UR5e arm on 3 real-world tasks by 76.9%.

However, this method has two primary drawbacks. First, heuristic\nalgorithms can only provide a single initial solution, which may lead to local\noptima and consequently diminish the quality of the solution. Second, the time\nefficiency of trajectory refinement based on numerical optimization is\ninsufficient. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes an overtaking\ntrajectory planning framework based on spatio-temporal topology and reachable\nset analysis (SROP), to improve trajectory quality and time efficiency.\nSpecifically, this paper introduces topological classes to describe\ntrajectories representing different overtaking behaviors, which support the\nspatio-temporal topological search method employed by the upper-layer planner\nto identify diverse initial paths. This approach helps prevent getting stuck in\nlocal optima, enhancing the overall solution quality by considering multiple\ninitial solutions from distinct topologies. Moreover, the reachable set method\nis integrated into the lower-layer planner for parallel trajectory evaluation.\nThis method enhances planning efficiency by decoupling vehicle model\nconstraints from the optimization process, enabling parallel computation while\nensuring control feasibility. Simulation results show that the proposed method\nimproves the smoothness of generated trajectories by 66.8% compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing\ntrajectory quality.

Despite their impressive performance,\nthese vision-based controllers can make erroneous predictions when faced with\nnovel or out-of-distribution inputs. Such errors can cascade into catastrophic\nsystem failures and compromise system safety. In this work, we compute Neural\nReachable Tubes, which act as parameterized approximations of Backward\nReachable Tubes to stress-test the vision-based controllers and mine their\nfailure modes. The identified failures are then used to enhance the system\nsafety through both offline and online methods. The online approach involves\ntraining a classifier as a run-time failure monitor to detect closed-loop,\nsystem-level failures, subsequently triggering a fallback controller that\nrobustly handles these detected failures to preserve system safety. For the\noffline approach, we improve the original controller via incremental training\nusing a carefully augmented failure dataset, resulting in a more robust\ncontroller that is resistant to the known failure modes. In either approach,\nthe system is safeguarded against shortcomings that transcend the vision-based\ncontroller and pertain to the closed-loop safety of the overall system.

However, CFR is\nonly allowed to be applied in known environments, where the transition function\nof the chance player and the reward function of the terminal node in IIEGs are\nknown. In uncertain situations, such as reinforcement learning (RL) problems,\nCFR is not applicable. Thus, applying CFR in unknown environments is a\nsignificant challenge that can also address some difficulties in the real\nworld.

Ultrasound-based speech enhancement has emerged as an\nattractive choice because of its superior ubiquity and performance. However,\ninevitable interference from unexpected and unintended sources during\naudio-ultrasound data acquisition makes existing solutions rely heavily on\nhuman effort for data collection and processing. This leads to significant data\nscarcity that limits the full potential of ultrasound-based speech enhancement.\nTo address this, we propose USpeech, a cross-modal ultrasound synthesis\nframework for speech enhancement with minimal human effort. At its core is a\ntwo-stage framework that establishes correspondence between visual and\nultrasonic modalities by leveraging audible audio as a bridge. This approach\novercomes challenges from the lack of paired video-ultrasound datasets and the\ninherent heterogeneity between video and ultrasound data. Our framework\nincorporates contrastive video-audio pre-training to project modalities into a\nshared semantic space and employs an audio-ultrasound encoder-decoder for\nultrasound synthesis. We then present a speech enhancement network that\nenhances speech in the time-frequency domain and recovers the clean speech\nwaveform via a neural vocoder. Comprehensive experiments show USpeech achieves\nremarkable performance using synthetic ultrasound data comparable to physical\ndata, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art ultrasound-based speech\nenhancement baselines.

In this context, human avatars and their representations are\na crucial aspect of collaborative VR applications as they represent a digital\ntwin of the end-users and determine how one is perceived in a virtual\nenvironment. When it comes to the effect of avatar representation on the\nend-users of collaborative VR applications, so far mostly questionnaires have\nbeen used to assess the quality of avatar representations. A promising\nalternative to objectively measure the effect of avatar representation is the\ninvestigation of inter-brain connections during the usage of a collaborative VR\napplication.

Thus, our work\ninvestigates how different human avatar representations (real (RL), full-body\n(FB), and head-hand (HH)) affect inter-brain connections. For this purpose, we\nhave designed and conducted a hyperscanning study with eight pairs. The main\nresults of our hyperscanning study show that the number of significant sensor\npairs was the highest in the RL, medium in the FB, and lowest in the HH\ncondition indicating that an avatar that looks more like a real human enables\nmore significant sensor pairs to appear in an EEG analysis.\n","authors":["Enes Yigitbas","Christian Kaltschmidt"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.21894v1.pdf","comment":"Paper Preprint, accepted at the 8th International Conference on\n  Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Reality (AIVR 24)"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21827v1","updated":"2024-10-29T07:51:08Z","published":"2024-10-29T07:51:08Z","title":"Cross-Domain Transfer Learning Method for Thermal Adaptive Behavior\n  Recognition with WiFi","summary":"  A reliable comfort model is essential to improve occupant satisfaction and\nreduce building energy consumption.

Inspired by\ncognitive theories on social communication, this paper introduces CulturePark,\nan LLM-powered multi-agent communication framework for cultural data\ncollection. CulturePark simulates cross-cultural human communication with\nLLM-based agents playing roles in different cultures. It generates high-quality\ncross-cultural dialogues encapsulating human beliefs, norms, and customs. Using\nCulturePark, we generated 41,000 cultural samples to fine-tune eight\nculture-specific LLMs. We evaluated these models across three downstream tasks:\ncontent moderation, cultural alignment, and cultural education. Results show\nthat for content moderation, our GPT-3.5-based models either match or\noutperform GPT-4 on datasets. Regarding cultural alignment, our models surpass\nGPT-4 on Hofstede's VSM 13 framework. Furthermore, for cultural education of\nhuman participants, our models demonstrate superior outcomes in both learning\nefficacy and user experience compared to GPT-4. CulturePark proves an important\nstep in addressing cultural bias and advancing the democratization of AI,\nhighlighting the critical role of culturally inclusive data in model training.\nCode is released at https://github.com/Scarelette/CulturePark.\n","authors":["Cheng Li","Damien Teney","Linyi Yang","Qingsong Wen","Xing Xie","Jindong Wang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.15145v2.pdf","comment":"NeurIPS 2024; Code is released at\n  https://github.com/Scarelette/CulturePark. arXiv admin note: substantial text\n  overlap with arXiv:2402.10946"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01641v2","updated":"2024-10-29T01:16:10Z","published":"2024-06-03T06:07:27Z","title":"Reciprocal Reward Influence Encourages Cooperation From Self-Interested\n  Agents","summary":"  Cooperation between self-interested individuals is a widespread phenomenon in\nthe natural world, but remains elusive in interactions between artificially\nintelligent agents. Instead, naive reinforcement learning algorithms typically\nconverge to Pareto-dominated outcomes in even the simplest of social dilemmas.\nAn emerging literature on opponent shaping has demonstrated the ability to\nreach prosocial outcomes by influencing the learning of other agents. However,\nsuch methods differentiate through the learning step of other agents or\noptimize for meta-game dynamics, which rely on privileged access to opponents'\nlearning algorithms or exponential sample complexity, respectively. To provide\na learning rule-agnostic and sample-efficient alternative, we introduce\nReciprocators, reinforcement learning agents which are intrinsically motivated\nto reciprocate the influence of opponents' actions on their returns. This\napproach seeks to modify other agents' $Q$-values by increasing their return\nfollowing beneficial actions (with respect to the Reciprocator) and decreasing\nit after detrimental actions, guiding them towards mutually beneficial actions\nwithout directly differentiating through a model of their policy.

In contrast, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) excel in scene\nunderstanding and reasoning. The path forward lies in merging the strengths of\nboth approaches. Previous methods using LVLMs to predict trajectories or\ncontrol signals yield suboptimal results, as LVLMs are not well-suited for\nprecise numerical predictions. This paper presents Senna, an autonomous driving\nsystem combining an LVLM (Senna-VLM) with an end-to-end model (Senna-E2E).\nSenna decouples high-level planning from low-level trajectory prediction.\nSenna-VLM generates planning decisions in natural language, while Senna-E2E\npredicts precise trajectories. Senna-VLM utilizes a multi-image encoding\napproach and multi-view prompts for efficient scene understanding. Besides, we\nintroduce planning-oriented QAs alongside a three-stage training strategy,\nwhich enhances Senna-VLM's planning performance while preserving commonsense.\nExtensive experiments on two datasets show that Senna achieves state-of-the-art\nplanning performance. Notably, with pre-training on a large-scale dataset\nDriveX and fine-tuning on nuScenes, Senna significantly reduces average\nplanning error by 27.12% and collision rate by 33.33% over model without\npre-training. We believe Senna's cross-scenario generalization and\ntransferability are essential for achieving fully autonomous driving.

However, these agents fail in unseen\ntrack configurations, always requiring complete retraining when presented with\nnew track layouts. This work aims to develop RL agents that generalize\neffectively to novel track configurations without retraining. The naive\nsolution of training directly on a diverse set of track layouts can overburden\nthe agent, resulting in suboptimal policy learning as the increased complexity\nof the environment impairs the agent's ability to learn to fly. To enhance the\ngeneralizability of the RL agent, we propose an adaptive environment-shaping\nframework that dynamically adjusts the training environment based on the\nagent's performance. We achieve this by leveraging a secondary RL policy to\ndesign environments that strike a balance between being challenging and\nachievable, allowing the agent to adapt and improve progressively.

Although different types of nonlinear KFs have different\npros and cons, they all use the same framework of linear KF. Yet, according to\nwhat we found in this paper, the framework often gives overconfident and less\naccurate state estimations when the measurement functions are nonlinear.\nTherefore, in this study, we designed a new framework for nonlinear KFs and\nshowed theoretically and empirically that the new framework estimates the\nstates and covariance matrix more accurately than the old one. The new\nframework was tested on four different nonlinear KFs and five different tasks,\nshowcasing its ability to reduce the estimation errors by several orders of\nmagnitude in low-measurement-noise conditions, with only about a 10 to 90%\nincrease in computational time.

However, when\ndealing with large-scale consumers, there are several challenges that must be\naddressed. One of these challenges is limited communication capabilities.\nAdditionally, prosumers may have specific preferences when it comes to trading.\nBoth can result in serious asynchrony in peer-to-peer trading, potentially\nimpacting the effectiveness of negotiations and hindering convergence before\nthe market closes. This paper introduces a connection-aware P2P trading\nalgorithm designed for extensive prosumer trading. The algorithm facilitates\nasynchronous trading while respecting prosumer's autonomy in trading peer\nselection, an often overlooked aspect in traditional models. In addition, to\noptimize the use of limited connection opportunities, a smart trading peer\nconnection selection strategy is developed to guide consumers to communicate\nstrategically to accelerate convergence. A theoretical convergence guarantee is\nprovided for the connection-aware P2P trading algorithm, which further details\nhow smart selection strategies enhance convergence efficiency.

The goal is to design algorithms whose performance degrades gently\nas a function of the prediction error and, in particular, perform well if the\nprediction is accurate, but also provide a worst-case guarantee under any\npossible error. This framework has been successfully applied recently to\nvarious mechanism design settings, where in most cases the mechanism is\nprovided with a prediction about the types of the players.\n  We adopt a perspective in which the mechanism is provided with an output\nrecommendation. We make no assumptions about the quality of the suggested\noutcome, and the goal is to use the recommendation to design mechanisms with\nlow approximation guarantees whenever the recommended outcome is reasonable,\nbut at the same time to provide worst-case guarantees whenever the\nrecommendation significantly deviates from the optimal one. We propose a\ngeneric, universal measure, which we call quality of recommendation, to\nevaluate mechanisms across various information settings.

However, much like\nother AI-powered tools, AI-powered code completions are not always accurate,\npotentially introducing bugs or even security vulnerabilities into code if not\nproperly detected and corrected by a human programmer. One technique that has\nbeen proposed and implemented to help programmers identify potential errors is\nto highlight uncertain tokens. However, there have been no empirical studies\nexploring the effectiveness of this technique -- nor investigating the\ndifferent and not-yet-agreed-upon notions of uncertainty in the context of\ngenerative models. We explore the question of whether conveying information\nabout uncertainty enables programmers to more quickly and accurately produce\ncode when collaborating with an AI-powered code completion tool, and if so,\nwhat measure of uncertainty best fits programmers' needs. Through a\nmixed-methods study with 30 programmers, we compare three conditions: providing\nthe AI system's code completion alone, highlighting tokens with the lowest\nlikelihood of being generated by the underlying generative model, and\nhighlighting tokens with the highest predicted likelihood of being edited by a\nprogrammer. We find that highlighting tokens with the highest predicted\nlikelihood of being edited leads to faster task completion and more targeted\nedits, and is subjectively preferred by study participants. In contrast,\nhighlighting tokens according to their probability of being generated does not\nprovide any benefit over the baseline with no highlighting.

Notably, existing fusion paradigms focus on empowering\nimplicit modality interactions (i.e., self-attention and its variants), but\nneglect to inject explicit modality interactions, especially from clinical\nknowledge and imaging property.

It is of\nvital importance in multimedia storage and communication. Existing MFFC methods\ntypically treat fragments as 1D byte sequences and emphasize the relations\nbetween separate bytes (interbytes) for classification. However, the more\ninformative relations inside bytes (intrabytes) are overlooked and seldom\ninvestigated. By looking inside bytes, the bit-level details of file fragments\ncan be accessed, enabling a more accurate classification. Motivated by this, we\nfirst propose Byte2Image, a novel visual representation model that incorporates\npreviously overlooked intrabyte information into file fragments and\nreinterprets these fragments as 2D grayscale images. This model involves a\nsliding byte window to reveal the intrabyte information and a rowwise stacking\nof intrabyte ngrams for embedding fragments into a 2D space.

In particular, the BBFE, composed of a\nsingle fully-connected layer, adaptively recognizes the co-occurrence of\nseveral some specific bytes within the raw byte sequence, while the IBFE, built\non a vision Transformer, effectively mines the complex interbyte and intrabyte\ncorrelations from the converted image.

Although it\nis easy to write an RRAM device into multiple (even quasi-continuous) states,\nit suffers from the inherent variations that should limit the storage capacity,\nespecially in the open-loop writing scenario. There have been many experimental\nresults in this regard, however, it lacks a comprehensive analysis of the valid\nmulti-bit storage capability, especially in theoretical terms. The absence of\nsuch an insight usually results in misleading conclusions that either\nexaggerate or underestimate the storage capacity of RRAM devices. Here, by the\nconcept of information theory, we present a model for evaluating the storage\ncapacity of open-loop written RRAM. Based on the experimental results in the\nliterature and the test results of our own devices, we have carefully examined\nthe effects of number of pre-defined levels, conductance variation, and\nconductance range, on the storage capacity.

Most existing\nmethods focus on static network structure without considering temporal\ndynamics. However, in real world, most networks (e.g., social and biological\nnetworks) are dynamic in nature and are constantly evolving over time. Such\ntemporal dynamics are critical in representations learning, especially for\npredicting dynamic networks behaviors. To this end, a Deep Hawkes Process based\nDynamic Networks Representation algorithm (DHPrep) is proposed in this paper,\nwhich is capable of capturing temporal dynamics of dynamic networks.\nSpecifically, DHPrep incorporates both structural information and temporal\ndynamics to learn vertices representations that can model the edge formation\nprocess for a vertex pair, where the structural information is used to capture\nthe historical impact from their neighborhood, and the temporal dynamics\nutilize this historical information and apply Hawkes point process to model the\nedges formation process. Moreover, a temporal smoother is further imposed to\nensure the representations evolve smoothly over time. To evaluate the\neffectiveness of DHPrep, extensive experiments are carried out using four\nreal-world datasets.

Existing works are mostly limited\nto mixture sampling, in which only a single sample is drawn in total, and the\nworks that do investigate multi-sample MIS only optimize the sample counts at a\nper-pixel level, which cannot account for variations beyond the first bounce.\nRecent work on Russian roulette and splitting has demonstrated how fixed-point\nschemes can be used to spatially vary sample counts to optimize image\nefficiency but is limited to choosing the same number of samples across all\nsampling strategies.

While previous research has shown\npromise, there are still limitations. Methods based on VAEs are accompanied by\nissues of local jitter and global instability, whereas methods based on\ndiffusion models are hampered by low generation efficiency. This is because the\ndenoising process of DDPM in the latter relies on the assumption that the noise\nadded at each step is sampled from a unimodal distribution, and the noise\nvalues are small. DDIM borrows the idea from the Euler method for solving\ndifferential equations, disrupts the Markov chain process, and increases the\nnoise step size to reduce the number of denoising steps, thereby accelerating\ngeneration. However, simply increasing the step size during the step-by-step\ndenoising process causes the results to gradually deviate from the original\ndata distribution, leading to a significant drop in the quality of the\ngenerated actions and the emergence of unnatural artifacts. In this paper, we\nbreak the assumptions of DDPM and achieves breakthrough progress in denoising\nspeed and fidelity. Specifically, we introduce a conditional GAN to capture\naudio control signals and implicitly match the multimodal denoising\ndistribution between the diffusion and denoising steps within the same sampling\nstep, aiming to sample larger noise values and apply fewer denoising steps for\nhigh-speed generation.\n","authors":["Yongkang Cheng","Mingjiang Liang","Shaoli Huang","Gaoge Han","Jifeng Ning","Wei Liu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.20359v1.pdf","comment":"Accepted by WACV 2025 (Round 1)"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20304v1","updated":"2024-10-27T02:00:33Z","published":"2024-10-27T02:00:33Z","title":"Deep Learning, Machine Learning -- Digital Signal and Image Processing:\n  From Theory to Application","summary":"  Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and Digital Image Processing (DIP) with\nMachine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) are popular research areas in\nComputer Vision and related fields.

However, reality is more complex and includes\nnoise, making traditional models assumptions not met in the market. In this\npaper, we explore the application of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to\nobtain optimal production strategies in microeconomic market environments to\novercome the limitations of traditional models. Concretely, we propose a\nDRL-based approach to obtain an effective policy in competitive markets with\nmultiple producers, each optimizing their production decisions in response to\nfluctuating demand, supply, prices, subsidies, fixed costs, total production\ncurve, elasticities and other effects contaminated by noise. Our framework\nenables agents to learn adaptive production policies to several simulations\nthat consistently outperform static and random strategies. As the deep neural\nnetworks used by the agents are universal approximators of functions, DRL\nalgorithms can represent in the network complex patterns of data learnt by\ntrial and error that explain the market. Through extensive simulations, we\ndemonstrate how DRL can capture the intricate interplay between production\ncosts, market prices, and competitor behavior, providing insights into optimal\ndecision-making in dynamic economic settings. The results show that agents\ntrained with DRL can strategically adjust production levels to maximize\nlong-term profitability, even in the face of volatile market conditions. We\nbelieve that the study bridges the gap between theoretical economic modeling\nand practical market simulation, illustrating the potential of DRL to\nrevolutionize decision-making in market strategies.\n","authors":["Eduardo C.

Their sizes have exploded to hundreds of billions of parameters and\nkeep increasing. Under these circumstances, the training of transformers is\nvery expensive and often hits a ``memory wall'', i.e., even when using 3D\nparallelism (pipeline, tensor, data) and aggregating the memory of many GPUs,\nit is still not enough to hold the necessary data structures (model parameters,\noptimizer state, gradients, activations) in GPU memory. To compensate,\nstate-of-the-art approaches offload the optimizer state, at least partially, to\nthe host memory and perform hybrid CPU-GPU computations. However, the\nmanagement of the combined host-GPU memory is often suboptimal and results in\npoor overlapping between data movements and computations. This leads to missed\nopportunities to simultaneously leverage the interconnect bandwidth and\ncomputational capabilities of CPUs and GPUs.

Our\nmethod encodes reconstructed scenes using a novel representation VoxSplat,\nwhich is a set of 3D Gaussians supported on a high-resolution sparse-voxel\nscaffold. To reconstruct a VoxSplat from images, we employ a hierarchical voxel\nlatent diffusion model conditioned on the input images followed by a\nfeedforward appearance prediction model. The diffusion model generates\nhigh-resolution grids progressively in a coarse-to-fine manner, and the\nappearance network predicts a set of Gaussians within each voxel. From as few\nas 3 non-overlapping input images, SCube can generate millions of Gaussians\nwith a 1024^3 voxel grid spanning hundreds of meters in 20 seconds. Past works\ntackling scene reconstruction from images either rely on per-scene optimization\nand fail to reconstruct the scene away from input views (thus requiring dense\nview coverage as input) or leverage geometric priors based on low-resolution\nmodels, which produce blurry results.

Specifically, based on\nVideoChat, we propose our long-video MLLM, coined as VideoChat-T, by\nimplementing a token shuffling to compress long video tokens and introducing\nTemporal Adaptive Position Encoding (TAPE) to enhance the temporal awareness of\nvisual representation. Meanwhile, we introduce the TimePro, a comprehensive\ngrounding-centric instruction tuning dataset composed of 9 tasks and 349k\nhigh-quality grounded annotations. Notably, we design a new instruction tuning\ntask type, called Temporal Grounded Caption, to peform detailed video\ndescriptions with the corresponding time stamps prediction. This explicit\ntemporal location prediction will guide MLLM to correctly attend on the visual\ncontent when generating description, and thus reduce the hallucination risk\ncaused by the LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that our TimeSuite\nprovides a successful solution to enhance the long video understanding\ncapability of short-form MLLM, achieving improvement of 5.6% and 6.8% on the\nbenchmarks of Egoschema and VideoMME, respectively.

Recently, Ge\net al. [10] proposed a new property called incentives for early arrival (I4EA)\nin such games, which says that the online allocation of values or costs should\nincentivize agents to join early in order to prevent mutual strategic waiting.\nIdeally, the allocation should also be fair, so that agents arriving in an\norder uniformly at random should expect to get/pay their Shapley values. Ge et\nal. [10] showed that not all monotone value functions admit such mechanisms in\nonline value sharing games. In this work, we show a sharp contrast in online\ncost sharing games. We construct a mechanism with all the properties mentioned\nabove, for every monotone cost function. To achieve this, we first solve 0-1\nvalued cost sharing games with a novel mechanism called Shapley-fair shuffle\ncost sharing mechanism (SFS-CS), and then extend SFS-CS to a family called\ngeneralized Shapley-fair shuffle cost sharing mechanisms (GSFS-CS). The\ncritical technique we invented here is a mapping from one arrival order to\nanother order so that we can directly apply marginal cost allocation on the\nshuffled orders to satisfy the properties.

Unlike common semantic segmentation,\ninteractive segmentation methods allow users to directly influence their output\nthrough prompts (e.g. clicks). However, click patterns in real-world\ninteractive segmentation scenarios remain largely unexplored. Most methods rely\non the assumption that users would click in the center of the largest erroneous\narea. Nevertheless, recent studies show that this is not always the case. Thus,\nmethods may have poor performance in real-world deployment despite high metrics\nin a baseline benchmark. To accurately simulate real-user clicks, we conducted\na large crowdsourcing study of click patterns in an interactive segmentation\nscenario and collected 475K real-user clicks. Drawing on ideas from saliency\ntasks, we develop a clickability model that enables sampling clicks, which\nclosely resemble actual user inputs. Using our model and dataset, we propose\nRClicks benchmark for a comprehensive comparison of existing interactive\nsegmentation methods on realistic clicks. Specifically, we evaluate not only\nthe average quality of methods, but also the robustness w.r.t. click patterns.\nAccording to our benchmark, in real-world usage interactive segmentation models\nmay perform worse than it has been reported in the baseline benchmark, and most\nof the methods are not robust. We believe that RClicks is a significant step\ntowards creating interactive segmentation methods that provide the best user\nexperience in real-world cases.\n","authors":["Anton Antonov","Andrey Moskalenko","Denis Shepelev","Alexander Krapukhin","Konstantin Soshin","Anton Konushin","Vlad Shakhuro"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.11722v2.pdf","comment":"Accepted by NeurIPS 2024"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06247v3","updated":"2024-10-24T15:45:33Z","published":"2024-01-11T20:21:40Z","title":"Trickery: Exploring a Serious Game Approach to Raise Awareness of\n  Deceptive Patterns","summary":"  Deceptive patterns are often used in interface design to manipulate users\ninto taking actions they would not otherwise take, such as consenting to\nexcessive data collection.

However,\nenabling current vision-aware multimodal emotion recognition models for\naffective human-robot interaction in the real-world raises embodiment\nchallenges: addressing the environmental noise issue and meeting real-time\nrequirements. First, in multiparty conversation scenarios, the noises inherited\nin the visual observation of the robot, which may come from either 1)\ndistracting objects in the scene or 2) inactive speakers appearing in the field\nof view of the robot, hinder the models from extracting emotional cues from\nvision inputs. Secondly, realtime response, a desired feature for an\ninteractive system, is also challenging to achieve.

We\ndefine the similarity and, vice versa, the deviation among vehicles based on\nthe desired driving speed of vehicles and their position on the road. We create\nthree approaches to solve this assignment problem: centralized solver,\ncentralized greedy, and distributed greedy, using a Mixed Integer Programming\n(MIP) solver and greedy heuristics, respectively. Conceptually, the approaches\ndiffer in both knowledge about vehicles as well as methodology. We perform a\nlarge-scale simulation study using PlaFoSim to compare all approaches. While\nthe distributed greedy approach seems to have disadvantages due to the limited\nlocal knowledge, it performs as good as the centralized solver approach across\nmost metrics. Both outperform the centralized greedy approach, which suffers\nfrom synchronization and greedy selection effects. The centralized solver\napproach however assumes global knowledge and requires a complex MIP solver to\ncompute vehicle-to-platoon assignments.

Both of these approaches decrease the asymptotic complexity\nof reaching new nodes from $O(k\\times \\log|C|)$ to $O(k + \\log(k) +\n\\log(|C|))$, where $k$ is the number of outgoing edges from a node and $|C|$ is\nthe size of the timetable information (total outgoing edges).

In addition, GenUDC adopts a two-stage, coarse-to-fine generative\nprocess for 3D mesh generation. It first generates the face part as a rough\nshape and then the vertex part to craft a detailed shape. Extensive evaluations\ndemonstrate the superiority of UDC as a mesh representation and the favorable\nperformance of GenUDC in mesh generation.

Our proposed method can achieve toolpaths\ncoverage between 87.5% and 90.6% by continuous fibers with 1.1mm width. Models\nfabricated using our toolpaths show up to 84.6% improvement in failure load and\n54.4% increase in stiffness when compared to the results obtained from\nmulti-axis 3D printing with sparser fibers.\n","authors":["Tianyu Zhang","Tao Liu","Neelotpal Dutta","Yongxue Chen","Renbo Su","Zhizhou Zhang","Weiming Wang","Charlie C.

We describe\na general technique for constructing such partitions that works for several\nnotions of `bounded size,' namely that each piece must be contained in an\naxis-aligned or arbitrarily rotated unit square or a unit disk, or that each\npiece has bounded perimeter, straight-line diameter or geodesic diameter. The\nproblems are motivated by practical settings in manufacturing, finite element\nanalysis, collision detection, vehicle routing, shipping and laser capture\nmicrodissection.\n  The version where each piece should be contained in an axis-aligned unit\nsquare is already known to be NP-hard [Abrahamsen and Stade, FOCS, 2024], and\nthe other versions seem no easier. Our main result is to develop\nconstant-factor approximation algorithms, which means that the number of pieces\nin the produced partition is at most a constant factor larger than the\ncardinality of an optimal partition. Existing algorithms [Damian and Pemmaraju,\nAlgorithmica, 2004] do not allow Steiner points, which means that all corners\nof the produced pieces must also be corners of $P$.

Consider a population of self-interested agents that make decisions\nunder uncertainty. They \"explore\" to acquire new information and \"exploit\" this\ninformation to make good decisions. Collectively they need to balance these two\nobjectives, but their incentives are skewed toward exploitation. This is\nbecause exploration is costly, but its benefits are spread over many agents in\nthe future.\n  \"Incentivized Exploration\" addresses this issue via strategic communication.\nConsider a benign ``principal\" which can communicate with the agents and make\nrecommendations, but cannot force the agents to comply. Moreover, suppose the\nprincipal can observe the agents' decisions and the outcomes of these\ndecisions. The goal is to design a communication and recommendation policy\nwhich (i) achieves a desirable balance between exploration and exploitation,\nand (ii) incentivizes the agents to follow recommendations. What makes it\nfeasible is \"information asymmetry\": the principal knows more than any one\nagent, as it collects information from many. It is essential that the principal\ndoes not fully reveal all its knowledge to the agents.\n  Incentivized exploration combines two important problems in, resp., machine\nlearning and theoretical economics. First, if agents always follow\nrecommendations, the principal faces a multi-armed bandit problem: essentially,\ndesign an algorithm that balances exploration and exploitation. Second,\ninteraction with a single agent corresponds to \"Bayesian persuasion\", where a\nprincipal leverages information asymmetry to convince an agent to take a\nparticular action.

To solve the problem,\nexisting approaches invariably use color and/or shape information but in many\nreal-world scenarios, such as in archaeological fresco reconstruction, this\nkind of clues is often unreliable due to severe physical and pictorial\ndeterioration of the individual fragments. This makes state-of-the-art\napproaches entirely unusable in practice. On the other hand, in such cases,\nsimple geometrical patterns such as lines or curves offer a powerful yet\nunexplored clue. In an attempt to fill in this gap, in this paper we introduce\na new challenging version of the puzzle solving problem in which one\ndeliberately ignores conventional color and shape features and relies solely on\nthe presence of linear geometrical patterns. The reconstruction process is then\nonly driven by one of the most fundamental principles of Gestalt perceptual\norganization, namely Wertheimer's {\\em law of good continuation}. In order to\ntackle this problem, we formulate the puzzle solving problem as the problem of\nfinding a Nash equilibrium of a (noncooperative) multiplayer game and use\nclassical multi-population replicator dynamics to solve it.

However, when the underlying stochastic\ndynamics of the environment experiences drastic distribution shifts, the\noptimal policy obtained in the trained environment may be sub-optimal or may\nentirely fail in helping find goal-reaching paths for the agent. Approaches\nlike domain randomization and robust RL can provide robust policies, but\ntypically assume minor (bounded) distribution shifts. For substantial\ndistribution shifts, retraining (either with a warm-start policy or from\nscratch) is an alternative approach. In this paper, we develop a novel approach\ncalled {\\em Evolutionary Robust Policy Optimization} (ERPO), an adaptive\nre-training algorithm inspired by evolutionary game theory (EGT). ERPO learns\nan optimal policy for the shifted environment iteratively using a temperature\nparameter that controls the trade off between exploration and adherence to the\nold optimal policy. The policy update itself is an instantiation of the\nreplicator dynamics used in EGT. We show that under fairly common sparsity\nassumptions on rewards in such environments, ERPO converges to the optimal\npolicy in the shifted environment. We empirically demonstrate that for path\nfinding tasks in a number of environments, ERPO outperforms several popular RL\nand deep RL algorithms (PPO, A3C, DQN) in many scenarios and popular\nenvironments. This includes scenarios where the RL algorithms are allowed to\ntrain from scratch in the new environment, when they are retrained on the new\nenvironment, or when they are used in conjunction with domain randomization.\nERPO shows faster policy adaptation, higher average rewards, and reduced\ncomputational costs in policy adaptation.\n","authors":["Sheryl Paul","Jyotirmoy V.

In this\npaper, we introduce an episodic future thinking (EFT) mechanism for a\nreinforcement learning (RL) agent, inspired by cognitive processes observed in\nanimals. To enable future thinking functionality, we first develop a\nmulti-character policy that captures diverse characters with an ensemble of\nheterogeneous policies.

The future thinking agent collects observation-action\ntrajectories of the target agents and uses the pre-trained multi-character\npolicy to infer their characters. Once the character is inferred, the agent\npredicts the upcoming actions of target agents and simulates the potential\nfuture scenario. This capability allows the agent to adaptively select the\noptimal action, considering the predicted future scenario in multi-agent\ninteractions. To evaluate the proposed mechanism, we consider the multi-agent\nautonomous driving scenario with diverse driving traits and multiple particle\nenvironments.

Our objective is to devise\na patrolling schedule with an infinite time horizon that minimizes the\nattacker's payoff. We demonstrated that PSG can be transformed into a\ncombinatorial minimax problem with a closed-form objective function. By\nconstraining the defender's strategy to a time-homogeneous first-order Markov\nchain (i.e., the patroller's next move depends solely on their current\nlocation), we proved that the optimal solution in cases of zero penalty\ninvolves either minimizing the expected hitting time or return time, depending\non the attacker model, and that these solutions can be computed efficiently.\nAdditionally, we observed that increasing the randomness in the patrol schedule\nreduces the attacker's expected payoff in high-penalty cases.

The goals and objectives of both the service\nprovider and service consumer agents are relevant to the goals of the\nrespective citizens (end users). The provider agents often pursue selfish goals\nthat can make the service quality highly volatile, contributing towards the\nnon-stationary nature of the environment. The number of active service\nproviders tends to change over time resulting in an open environment. This\nnecessitates a rapid and continual assessment of the Trust and Reputation. A\nlarge number of service providers in the environment require a distributed\nmulti-agent Trust and Reputation assessment. This paper addresses the problem\nof multi-agent Trust and Reputation Assessment in a non-stationary environment\ninvolving transactions between providers and consumers. In this setting, the\nobserver agents carry out the assessment and communicate their assessed trust\nscores with each other over a network. We propose a novel Distributed Online\nLife-Long Learning (DOL3) algorithm that involves real-time rapid learning of\ntrust and reputation scores of providers. Each observer carries out an adaptive\nlearning and weighted fusion process combining their own assessment along with\nthat of their neighbour in the communication network. Simulation studies reveal\nthat the state-of-the-art methods, which usually involve training a model to\nassess an agent's trust and reputation, do not work well in such an\nenvironment. The simulation results show that the proposed DOL3 algorithm\noutperforms these methods and effectively handles the volatility in such\nenvironments. From the statistical evaluation, it is evident that DOL3 performs\nbetter compared to other models in 90% of the cases.\n","authors":["Hariprasauth Ramamoorthy","Shubhankar Gupta","Suresh Sundaram"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.16529v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02161v2","updated":"2024-10-21T21:20:29Z","published":"2024-05-03T15:08:25Z","title":"Simulating the Economic Impact of Rationality through Reinforcement\n  Learning and Agent-Based Modelling","summary":"  Agent-based models (ABMs) are simulation models used in economics to overcome\nsome of the limitations of traditional frameworks based on general equilibrium\nassumptions. However, agents within an ABM follow predetermined 'bounded\nrational' behavioural rules which can be cumbersome to design and difficult to\njustify. Here we leverage multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) to expand the\ncapabilities of ABMs with the introduction of 'fully rational' agents that\nlearn their policy by interacting with the environment and maximising a reward\nfunction. Specifically, we propose a 'Rational macro ABM' (R-MABM) framework by\nextending a paradigmatic macro ABM from the economic literature. We show that\ngradually substituting ABM firms in the model with RL agents, trained to\nmaximise profits, allows for studying the impact of rationality on the economy.\nWe find that RL agents spontaneously learn three distinct strategies for\nmaximising profits, with the optimal strategy depending on the level of market\ncompetition and rationality. We also find that RL agents with independent\npolicies, and without the ability to communicate with each other, spontaneously\nlearn to segregate into different strategic groups, thus increasing market\npower and overall profits. Finally, we find that a higher number of rational\n(RL) agents in the economy always improves the macroeconomic environment as\nmeasured by total output. Depending on the specific rational policy, this can\ncome at the cost of higher instability. Our R-MABM framework allows for stable\nmulti-agent learning, is available in open source, and represents a principled\nand robust direction to extend economic simulators.\n","authors":["Simone Brusatin","Tommaso Padoan","Andrea Coletta","Domenico Delli Gatti","Aldo Glielmo"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.02161v2.pdf","comment":"9 pages, 4 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16464v1","updated":"2024-10-21T19:46:06Z","published":"2024-10-21T19:46:06Z","title":"Beyond Browsing: API-Based Web Agents","summary":"  Web browsers are a portal to the internet, where much of human activity is\nundertaken.

We\nconsider a system where a source seeks to offload data to an access point (AP)\nwhile balancing both the timeliness and energy-efficiency of the transmission.\nA deep fade in the communication channel (due to, e.g., a line-of-sight\nblockage) makes direct communication costly, and the source may alternatively\nrely on non-cooperative UEs to act as relays. We propose a multi-attribute\nauction to select a UE and to determine the duration and power of the\ntransmission, with payments to the UE taking the form of energy sent via\nwireless power transfer (WPT). The quality of the channel from a UE to the AP\nconstitutes private information, and bids consist of a transmission time and\ntransmission power. We show that under a second-preferred-offer auction,\ntruthful bidding by all candidate UEs forms a Nash Equilibrium. However, this\nauction is not incentive compatible, and we present a modified auction in which\ntruthful bidding is in fact a dominant strategy.

In order to execute operations on the\nlunar surface and to safely live on the Moon for an extended period of time,\ninnovative training methodologies and tools such as XR are becoming paramount\nto perform pre-mission validation and certification. This research work\npresents the findings of the experiments aimed at exploring the integration of\nXR technology and parabolic flight activities for astronaut training. In\naddition, the study aims to consolidate these findings into a set of guidelines\nthat can assist future researchers who wish to incorporate XR technology into\nlunar training and preparation activities, including the use of such XR tools\nduring long duration missions.\n","authors":["Florian Saling","Andrea Emanuele Maria Casini","Andreas Treuer","Martial Costantini","Leonie Bensch","Tommy Nilsson","Lionel Ferra"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.14922v1.pdf","comment":"75th International Astronautical Congress (IAC), Milan, Italy, 14-18\n  October 2024"}]},"2024-10-18T00:00:00Z":{"Computational Geometry":[{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05231v2","updated":"2024-10-18T15:51:31Z","published":"2024-07-07T01:54:54Z","title":"Fréchet Distance in Subquadratic Time","summary":"  Let $m$ and $n$ be the numbers of vertices of two polygonal curves in\n$\\mathbb{R}^d$ for any fixed $d$ such that $m \\leq n$.

Rather than\nmodelling a zero-sum game between the tracker and the evader, which presupposes\nthe availability of perfect information, in this paper we model both the\ntracker and the evader as playing separate zero-sum games at each time step\nwith an internal (and imperfect) model of the other player.

This is accomplished by committing to a payment scheme (a.k.a.\ncontract) at each step, specifying a monetary transfer from the principal to\nthe agent for every possible outcome.

Traditional approaches using high-resolution\nimage stacks and standard CNNs on dense voxel grids face challenges in\ncomputational efficiency, limited resolution, local context, and inadequate\npreservation of shape topology. Our method addresses these issues by shifting\nfrom dense voxel to sparse point representation, offering better memory\nefficiency and global context utilization.

The key complication is whether\nthe free-riding behavior discourages information contribution by participating\nfirms and results in the decomposition of FL, and even free riding does not\ndiscourage information contribution, this does not necessarily mean that a firm\nwants to form FL in a competitive market because free riding may reshape the\ncompetition positions of each participating firm and thus forming FL may not be\nprofitable. We build a parsimonious game theoretical model that captures these\ninteractions and our analyses show several new findings. First, even in the\npresence of the free-riding behavior, competing firms under FL find it optimal\nto contribute all its available information. Second, the firm with less amount\nof information always finds it profitable to free ride; whether its rival (with\nmore amount of information) have an incentive to form FL only when the level of\ncompetition or when the gap in information volume is not high. Third, when FL\nis formed, there exists an \"All-Win\" situation in which all stakeholders\n(participating firms, consumers, and social planner) benefit. Last, subsidizing\nby the free-riding firm can align its rival's incentive to form FL only when\nthe level of competition is intermediate.\n","authors":["Jiajun Meng","Jing Chen","Dongfang Zhao","Lin Liu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.12723v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12633v1","updated":"2024-10-16T14:53:42Z","published":"2024-10-16T14:53:42Z","title":"Decline Now: A Combinatorial Model for Algorithmic Collective Action","summary":"  Drivers on food delivery platforms often run a loss on low-paying orders.

In recent\nyears, the density-equalizing map, a shape deformation technique based on the\nphysical principle of density diffusion, has been utilized for the\nparameterization of simply connected and multiply connected open surfaces. More\nrecently, a spherical density-equalizing mapping method has been developed for\nthe parameterization of genus-0 closed surfaces. However, for genus-0 closed\nsurfaces with extreme geometry, using a spherical domain for the\nparameterization may induce large geometric distortion. In this work, we\ndevelop a novel method for computing density-equalizing maps of genus-0 closed\nsurfaces onto an ellipsoidal domain. This allows us to achieve ellipsoidal\narea-preserving parameterizations and ellipsoidal parameterizations with\ncontrolled area change. We further propose an energy minimization approach that\ncombines density-equalizing maps and quasi-conformal maps, which allows us to\nproduce ellipsoidal density-equalizing quasi-conformal maps for achieving a\nbalance between density-equalization and quasi-conformality.

Existing\nmethods, such as sample-level Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) and\ndistribution-based dataset inference, distinguish member data (data used for\ntraining) and non-member data by leveraging the common observation that models\ntend to memorize and show greater confidence in member data. Nevertheless,\nthese methods face challenges when applied to LLMs and VLMs, such as the\nrequirement for ground-truth member data or non-member data that shares the\nsame distribution as the test data. In this paper, we propose a novel\ndataset-level membership inference method based on Self-Comparison. We find\nthat a member prefix followed by a non-member suffix (paraphrased from a member\nsuffix) can further trigger the model's memorization on training data. Instead\nof directly comparing member and non-member data, we introduce paraphrasing to\nthe second half of the sequence and evaluate how the likelihood changes before\nand after paraphrasing. Unlike prior approaches, our method does not require\naccess to ground-truth member data or non-member data in identical\ndistribution, making it more practical. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nour proposed method outperforms traditional MIA and dataset inference\ntechniques across various datasets and models, including including public\nmodels, fine-tuned models, and API-based commercial models.\n","authors":["Jie Ren","Kangrui Chen","Chen Chen","Vikash Sehwag","Yue Xing","Jiliang Tang","Lingjuan Lyu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.13088v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12957v1","updated":"2024-10-16T18:44:56Z","published":"2024-10-16T18:44:56Z","title":"MuVi: Video-to-Music Generation with Semantic Alignment and Rhythmic\n  Synchronization","summary":"  Generating music that aligns with the visual content of a video has been a\nchallenging task, as it requires a deep understanding of visual semantics and\ninvolves generating music whose melody, rhythm, and dynamics harmonize with the\nvisual narratives.

Despite extensive research on Large Language Models (LLMs),\nthe challenge of Text-to-Image (T2I) model alignment remains largely\nunexplored.

LiVO only optimizes a plug-and-play value encoder to integrate a\nspecified value principle with the input prompt, allowing the control of\ngenerated images over both semantics and values. Specifically, we design a\ndiffusion model-tailored preference optimization loss, which theoretically\napproximates the Bradley-Terry model used in LLM alignment but provides a more\nflexible trade-off between image quality and value conformity. To optimize the\nvalue encoder, we also develop a framework to automatically construct a\ntext-image preference dataset of 86k (prompt, aligned image, violating image,\nvalue principle) samples. Without updating most model parameters and through\nadaptive value selection from the input prompt, LiVO significantly reduces\nharmful outputs and achieves faster convergence, surpassing several strong\nbaselines and taking an initial step towards ethically aligned T2I models.\n","authors":["Xingqi Wang","Xiaoyuan Yi","Xing Xie","Jia Jia"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.12700v1.pdf","comment":"Accepted by ACM Multimedia 2024.

In optimal mechanisms, the mediator directly\nrecommends whether to trade after eliciting the agents' types. The mediator\nprivately offers a price to each agent if a trade is recommended. The optimal\nmechanism adopts a threshold information structure, i.e., it only reveals to\nthe agent whether the other agent's type exceeds a certain threshold. The\noptimal payment function of buyer is monotone decreasing to their type, which\ndiffers from most existing works.

However, as text\ninputs become longer, existing encoding methods like CLIP face limitations, and\naligning the generated images with long texts becomes challenging. To tackle\nthese issues, we propose LongAlign, which includes a segment-level encoding\nmethod for processing long texts and a decomposed preference optimization\nmethod for effective alignment training. For segment-level encoding, long texts\nare divided into multiple segments and processed separately. This method\novercomes the maximum input length limits of pretrained encoding models. For\npreference optimization, we provide decomposed CLIP-based preference models to\nfine-tune diffusion models. Specifically, to utilize CLIP-based preference\nmodels for T2I alignment, we delve into their scoring mechanisms and find that\nthe preference scores can be decomposed into two components: a text-relevant\npart that measures T2I alignment and a text-irrelevant part that assesses other\nvisual aspects of human preference. Additionally, we find that the\ntext-irrelevant part contributes to a common overfitting problem during\nfine-tuning. To address this, we propose a reweighting strategy that assigns\ndifferent weights to these two components, thereby reducing overfitting and\nenhancing alignment.

To alleviate\nthis problem, we first analyze the under-optimized phenomenon from both the\nfeed-forward and the back-propagation stages during optimization.

Moreover, the proposed TCAM needs ultra-low\nenergy (1.36 aJ and 26.5 aJ average energy consumption for 1-bit binary and\nternary search, respectively), thanks to the use of energy-efficient SQUIDs.\nFinally, we show the efficiency of FeSQUID through the brain-inspired\napplication of Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC). Here, the FeSQUID-based TCAM\nimplements the associative memory to support the highly parallel search needed\nin the inference step. We estimate an energy consumption of 89.4 fJ per vector\ncomparison using a vector size of 10,000 bits. We also compare the\nFeSQUID-based TCAM array with the 5nm FinFET-based cryogenic SRAM-based TCAM\narray and observe that the proposed FeSQUID-based TCAM array consumes over one\norder of magnitude lower energy while performing the same task.\n","authors":["Shamiul Alam","Simon Thomann","Shivendra Singh Parihar","Yogesh Singh Chauhan","Kai Ni","Hussam Amrouch","Ahmedullah Aziz"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.11091v1.pdf","comment":"6 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10946v1","updated":"2024-10-14T18:00:00Z","published":"2024-10-14T18:00:00Z","title":"Equivalence Checking of Quantum Circuits via Intermediary Matrix Product\n  Operator","summary":"  As quantum computing advances, the complexity of quantum circuits is rapidly\nincreasing, driving the need for robust methods to aid in their design.\nEquivalence checking plays a vital role in identifying errors that may arise\nduring compilation and optimization of these circuits and is a critical step in\nquantum circuit verification.

In particular, after a change of variables,\nSDS resembles a high-variance version of Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models\n(DDIM) with a differently-sampled noise term: SDS introduces noise i.i.d.\nrandomly at each step, while DDIM infers it from the previous noise\npredictions.

Recently, the emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting has provided new\ninsights into this problem. Although subsequent efforts rapidly extend static\n3D Gaussian to dynamic scenes, they often lack explicit constraints on object\nmotion, leading to optimization difficulties and performance degradation. To\naddress the above issues, we propose a novel deformable 3D Gaussian splatting\nframework called MotionGS, which explores explicit motion priors to guide the\ndeformation of 3D Gaussians. Specifically, we first introduce an optical flow\ndecoupling module that decouples optical flow into camera flow and motion flow,\ncorresponding to camera movement and object motion respectively. Then the\nmotion flow can effectively constrain the deformation of 3D Gaussians, thus\nsimulating the motion of dynamic objects. Additionally, a camera pose\nrefinement module is proposed to alternately optimize 3D Gaussians and camera\nposes, mitigating the impact of inaccurate camera poses.

Using this\nrepresentation, we introduce MagicClay - an artist friendly tool for sculpting\nregions of a mesh according to textual prompts while keeping other regions\nuntouched. Our framework carefully and efficiently balances consistency between\nthe representations and regularizations in every step of the shape\noptimization; Relying on the mesh representation, we show how to render the SDF\nat higher resolutions and faster. In addition, we employ recent work in\ndifferentiable mesh reconstruction to adaptively allocate triangles in the mesh\nwhere required, as indicated by the SDF. Using an implemented prototype, we\ndemonstrate superior generated geometry compared to the state-of-the-art, and\nnovel consistent control, allowing sequential prompt-based edits to the same\nmesh for the first time.\n","authors":["Amir Barda","Vladimir G.

However, the efficiency of\nthe 3D Gaussian Splatting rendering pipeline relies on several simplifications.\nNotably, reducing Gaussian to 2D splats with a single view-space depth\nintroduces popping and blending artifacts during view rotation. Addressing this\nissue requires accurate per-pixel depth computation, yet a full per-pixel sort\nproves excessively costly compared to a global sort operation. In this paper,\nwe present a novel hierarchical rasterization approach that systematically\nresorts and culls splats with minimal processing overhead. Our software\nrasterizer effectively eliminates popping artifacts and view inconsistencies,\nas demonstrated through both quantitative and qualitative measurements.\nSimultaneously, our method mitigates the potential for cheating view-dependent\neffects with popping, ensuring a more authentic representation. Despite the\nelimination of cheating, our approach achieves comparable quantitative results\nfor test images, while increasing the consistency for novel view synthesis in\nmotion. Due to its design, our hierarchical approach is only 4% slower on\naverage than the original Gaussian Splatting. Notably, enforcing consistency\nenables a reduction in the number of Gaussians by approximately half with\nnearly identical quality and view-consistency.

To address this, we propose\n\\textbf{FreeAvatar}, a robust facial animation transfer method that relies\nsolely on our learned expression representation. Specifically, FreeAvatar\nconsists of two main components: the expression foundation model and the facial\nanimation transfer model. In the first component, we initially construct a\nfacial feature space through a face reconstruction task and then optimize the\nexpression feature space by exploring the similarities among different\nexpressions.

However, the\ndiversity of interaction modes, keyboard sizes, and visual feedback in these\nenvironments introduces divergent word-gesture trajectory data patterns, thus\nleading to complexity in decoding trajectories into text. Template-matching\ndecoding methods, such as SHARK^2, are commonly used for these WGK systems\nbecause they are easy to implement and configure.

However, these compact embeddings\nstruggle to capture fine details such as contours and textures, resulting in\nimperfect reconstructions. Furthermore, existing learning-based codecs lack\nscalability. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a\ncontent-adaptive diffusion model for scalable image compression. The proposed\nmethod encodes fine textures through a diffusion process, enhancing perceptual\nquality while preserving essential features for machine vision tasks. The\napproach employs a Markov palette diffusion model combined with widely used\nfeature extractors and image generators, enabling efficient data compression.\nBy leveraging collaborative texture-semantic feature extraction and\npseudo-label generation, the method accurately captures texture information. A\ncontent-adaptive Markov palette diffusion model is then applied to represent\nboth low-level textures and high-level semantic content in a scalable manner.\nThis framework offers flexible control over compression ratios by selecting\nintermediate diffusion states, eliminating the need for retraining deep\nlearning models at different operating points.

The rising global\npopularity of Japanese manga has made the object detection of character faces\nincreasingly important, with potential applications such as automatic\ncolorization. However, obtaining sufficient data for training conventional\nobject detectors is challenging due to copyright restrictions. Additionally,\nnew characters appear every time a new volume of manga is released, making it\nimpractical to re-train object detectors each time to detect these new\ncharacters. Therefore, one-shot object detection, where only a single query\n(reference) image is required to detect a new character, is an essential task\nin the manga industry. One challenge with one-shot object detection in manga is\nthe large variation in the poses and facial expressions of characters in target\nimages, despite having only one query image as a reference. Another challenge\nis that the frequency of character appearances follows a long-tail\ndistribution. To overcome these challenges, we propose a data augmentation\nmethod in feature space to increase the variation of the query.

Existing OVD methods mainly rely on the powerful open-vocabulary\nimage-text alignment capability of Vision-Language Pretrained Models (VLM) such\nas CLIP. However, CLIP is trained on image-text pairs and lacks the perceptual\nability for local regions within an image, resulting in the gap between image\nand region representations. Directly using CLIP for OVD causes inaccurate\nregion classification. We find the image-region gap is primarily caused by the\ndeformation of region feature maps during region of interest (RoI) extraction.\nTo mitigate the inaccurate region classification in OVD, we propose a new\nShape-Invariant Adapter named SIA-OVD to bridge the image-region gap in the OVD\ntask. SIA-OVD learns a set of feature adapters for regions with different\nshapes and designs a new adapter allocation mechanism to select the optimal\nadapter for each region. The adapted region representations can align better\nwith text representations learned by CLIP. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat SIA-OVD effectively improves the classification accuracy for regions by\naddressing the gap between images and regions caused by shape deformation.\nSIA-OVD achieves substantial improvements over representative methods on the\nCOCO-OVD benchmark.

An active frontier in\nrepresentation learning is understanding representations for combinatorial\nstructures which may not admit well-behaved local neighborhoods or distance\nfunctions. For example, for polygons, slightly perturbing vertex locations\nmight lead to significant changes in their combinatorial structure and may even\nlead to invalid polygons. In this paper, we investigate representations to\ncapture the underlying combinatorial structures of polygons. Specifically, we\nstudy the open problem of Visibility Reconstruction: Given a visibility graph\nG, construct a polygon P whose visibility graph is G.\n  We introduce VisDiff, a novel diffusion-based approach to reconstruct a\npolygon from its given visibility graph G. Our method first estimates the\nsigned distance function (SDF) of P from G. Afterwards, it extracts ordered\nvertex locations that have the pairwise visibility relationship given by the\nedges of G. Our main insight is that going through the SDF significantly\nimproves learning for reconstruction.

A correct, complete and practical\npath planner for such a robot has never been achieved, although this is widely\nrecognized as a key challenge in robotics. This paper provides a complete\n\"explicit\" design, down to explicit geometric primitives that are easily\nimplementable.\n  Our design is within an algorithmic framework for path planners, called Soft\nSubdivision Search (SSS). The framework is based on the twin foundations of\n$\\epsilon$-exactness and soft predicates, which are critical for rigorous\nnumerical implementations. The practicality of SSS has been previously\ndemonstrated for various robots including 5-DOF spatial robots.\n  In this paper, we solve several significant technical challenges for SE(3)\nrobots: (1) We first ensure the correct theory by proving a general form of the\nFundamental Theorem of the SSS theory. We prove this within an axiomatic\nframework, thus making it easy for future applications of this theory. (2) One\ncomponent of $SE(3) = R^3 \\times SO(3)$ is the non-Euclidean space SO(3). We\ndesign a novel topologically correct data structure for SO(3). Using the\nconcept of subdivision charts and atlases for SO(3), we can now carry out\nsubdivision of SO(3). (3) The geometric problem of collision detection takes\nplace in $R^3$, via the footprint map. Unlike sampling-based approaches, we\nmust reason with the notion of footprints of configuration boxes, which is much\nharder to characterize. Exploiting the theory of soft predicates, we design\nsuitable approximate footprints which, when combined with the highly effective\nfeature-set technique, lead to soft predicates. (4) Finally, we make the\nunderlying geometric computation \"explicit\", i.e., avoiding a general solver of\npolynomial systems, in order to allow a direct implementation.\n","authors":["Zhaoqi Zhang","Yi-Jen Chiang","Chee Yap"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05135v2.pdf","comment":"A conference version is to appear at the International Workshop on\n  the Algorithmic Foundations of Robotics (WAFR) 2024.

GNNs aim to address\nvarious graph-related tasks by utilizing such node representations, however,\nthis one-size-fits-all approach proves suboptimal for diverse tasks.\n  Motivated by these observations, we conduct empirical tests to compare the\nperformance of current GNN models with more conventional and direct methods in\nlink prediction tasks. Introducing our model, PROXI, which leverages proximity\ninformation of node pairs in both graph and attribute spaces, we find that\nstandard machine learning (ML) models perform competitively, even outperforming\ncutting-edge GNN models when applied to these proximity metrics derived from\nnode neighborhoods and attributes. This holds true across both homophilic and\nheterophilic networks, as well as small and large benchmark datasets, including\nthose from the Open Graph Benchmark (OGB). Moreover, we show that augmenting\ntraditional GNNs with PROXI significantly boosts their link prediction\nperformance. Our empirical findings corroborate the previously mentioned\ntheoretical observations and imply that there exists ample room for enhancement\nin current GNN models to reach their potential.\n","authors":["Astrit Tola","Jack Myrick","Baris Coskunuzer"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01802v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04507v2","updated":"2024-10-02T07:52:37Z","published":"2024-09-06T16:32:46Z","title":"3D Data Long-Term Preservation in Cultural Heritage","summary":"  The report explores the challenges and strategies for preserving 3D digital\ndata in cultural heritage.

Here, we\npropose an architecture to prepare and perform logical quantum operations on\narbitrary multimode multi-photon states using a quantum photonic neural\nnetwork. Central to our approach is the optical nonlinearity, which is realized\nthrough strong light-matter interaction with a three-level Lambda atomic\nsystem. The dynamics of this interaction are confined to the single-mode\nsubspace, enabling the construction of high-fidelity quantum gates. This\nnonlinearity functions as a photon-number selective phase gate, which\nfacilitates the construction of a universal gate set and serves as the\nelement-wise activation function in our neural network architecture. Through\nnumerical simulations, we demonstrate the versatility of our approach by\nexecuting tasks that are key to logical quantum information processing. The\nnetwork is able to deterministically prepare a wide array of multimode\nmulti-photon states, including essential resource states.

Therefore, this study proposes\nthe development of comprehensive charging stations capable of accommodating\nboth battery and hydrogen vehicles to address this challenge. The energy is\npurchased from the day-ahead and intraday auction-based electricity markets,\nwhere the electricity price is subject to uncertainty.

The\nstate-of-the-art algorithm [Karp, Luby, Madras '89] for union volume estimation\nand Klee's measure problem in constant dimension $d$ computes a\n$(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximation with constant success probability by using a\ntotal of $O(n/\\varepsilon^2)$ queries of the form (i) ask for the volume of\n$O_i$, (ii) sample a point uniformly at random from $O_i$, and (iii) query\nwhether a given point is contained in $O_i$.\n  We show that if one can only interact with the objects via the aforementioned\nthree queries, the query complexity of [Karp, Luby, Madras '89] is indeed\noptimal, i.e., $\\Omega(n/\\varepsilon^2)$ queries are necessary.
